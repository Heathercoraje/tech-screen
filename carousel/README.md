# Carousel done by heathercoraje

### user story

* User can check her/his credit score and longterm debt
* Arc indicates credit score ratio out of 700
* User can use responsive interface on mobile

### Favorite part of code

* Adding eventListener on `resize` event
* `calculateSize` function to detect innerWidth of current view size

### Stretch goal

I would like to add the following

* The arc animates on load with a short lag
* User can click/swipe to check other information of credit report(short term debt, credit limit, etc)
* Integrate module for dynamic and fun animation effect for slides
* Change background at certain interval
* A link to download a pfd of current credit report

## Getting Started

* Run: `yarn start:cc` or `npm run start:cc`
* Goto: `http://localhost:3000/`
